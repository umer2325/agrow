# AGROW - Smart Irrigation
Our project is called AGROW which is an IoT based Smart Drip Irrigation system.      The main purpose of this project is to design an IoT based smart farm irrigation system that caterers to the water conservation needs of Pakistan. Drip Irrigation enables us to deliver water to the roots of the plants, thus, delivering it where it is needed and in the exact amount that is needed. It avoids water over-tension and help the plant grow faster leading to improved growth. Instead of implementing a normal drip irrigation system, we have worked on the automation of the drip irrigation system. Automation will be done by using various sensors to determine the moisture content of the soil and proper data of the sensors will be sent to the farmer using the wireless communication techniques. Moreover, we have built an application which will be installed in the mobile and the farmer could analyze the moisture content with the help of heat maps. After obtaining the data from the sensors, the valves will open and water will be supplied and as soon as the water requirement of the soil is fulfilled, farmer will be notified, and the valves will be closed.
